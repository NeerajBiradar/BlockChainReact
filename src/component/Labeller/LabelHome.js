          <h2 className='mb-3'>What is blockchain?</h2>
          <p className='mb-5'>
            Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. Each
            block in the chain contains a timestamp and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating an unbreakable
            chain of records that cannot be tampered with.
          </p>
          <h2 className='mb-3'>How does our patch management system work?</h2>
          <p>
            Our system uses blockchain technology to securely track and manage patches across your organization's systems.
            Each patch is assigned a unique identifier and stored on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of all
            patches applied and their status. This ensures that your systems remain up-to-date and secure, while also providing
            complete transparency into the patch management process.
